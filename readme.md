<h2>Assignment 10/11 - HoneyPot</h2>

For this assignment, we were to create a VM instance via a cloud environment and deploy a honeypot so that we can catch hackers and get sensitive information from them. In a sense, we're hacking the hackers as security "professionals".

The service that we will be using as our honey pot is the <b>Modern Honey Network</b> which is an open source honeypot which is well supported, but also very basic for our usecase and to showcase what an acutal honeypot can do.

In terms of cloud provider, the guide followed <b>Google Cloud Platform</b> so I decided to follow that. Upon completion, this can also be easily setup in AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Microsoft's Azure Cloud Platform. Below will be GIFs on how I deployed the Modern Honey Network (Admin Console), The Dioanaea HoneyPot Deployment, and a screenshot of the database (copy of the source is included in the repository).
